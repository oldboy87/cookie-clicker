<!--Commited and pushed: main-logic branch 05/12/2025: 09.52:
- Added hero-cookie img to html
- Started working on a universal eventHandler for all clickable elements in the game.
  ===[ removeEventListener() ] === could come in handy for elements that can only be clicked once (or under certain conditions) but are not removed immediately.
- Added villain-cookie to html just to test event listener/handler interactions
- Added:
  listClickables
  heroCookie()
  villainCookie()
  objectClickID
  makeClickable()
  clickHandler(e)

- Fetch from cookie-upgrade-api =[ Ran into some problems because I wasn't taking into account async properly. Although I understood it, I was thrown for a loop by a console.log that wasn't after an await operator. It was showing the fetched data which made me improperly evaluate what was happening! Bertie kindly steered me back on track by informing me that the console.log will actually update it's message after response received!]=
- Tidied up commented out test code and added signposting comments
